# Modeling
In this phase, various modeling techniques are selected and applied, and their parameters are calibrated to optimal values. Typically, there are several techniques for the same data mining problem type. Some techniques have specific requirements on the form of data. Therefore, stepping back to the data preparation phase is often needed.

## 1. Select Modeling Technique

## 2. Generate Test Design 


## 3. Build Model Parameter settings


## 4. Assess Model
